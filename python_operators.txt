Python divides the operators in the following groups:

Arithmetic operators
Assignment operators
Comparison operators
Logical operators
Identity operators
Membership operators
Bitwise operators

Python Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:

Operator	Name	         Example
+	        Addition	     x + y
-	        Subtraction    	 x - y
*	        Multiplication	 x * y
/	        Division	     x / y
%	        Modulus	         x % y
**	        Exponentiation	 x ** y
//       	Floor division	 x // y


Python Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:

Operator	Description	                                              Example	
and     	Returns True if both statements are true	              x < 5 and  x < 10
or	        Returns True if one of the statements is true	          x < 5 or x < 4	
not     	Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true	  not(x < 5 and x < 10)


The precedence order is described in the table below, starting with the highest precedence at the top:

Operator	               Description
()	                       Parentheses
**	                       Exponentiation
+x  -x  ~x	               Unary plus, unary minus, and bitwise NOT
*  /  //  %	               Multiplication, division, floor division, and modulus
+  -	                   Addition and subtraction
<<  >>	                   Bitwise left and right shifts
&	                       Bitwise AND
^	                       Bitwise XOR
|	                       Bitwise OR
==  !=  >  >=  <  <=
is  is not  in  not in     Comparisons, identity, and membership operators
not	                       Logical NOT
and	                       AND
or	                       OR
